### Bonds

*Still figuring out how to mark this.*

Using symbols for tick marks doesn't work very well because markdown tries to render them.

> Progress Track
>
> | = 1 tick
>
> \+ = 2 ticks
>
> % = 3 ticks
>
> \* = 4 ticks or 1 progress

**Bonds: 3/40**


- **Gwen Del the Forager** *(Sick, Dying, Stern)* whose goal is to create an item.
  She wants to create a potion to cure her sickness.
- **Tio Tahir the Farmer** *(Skilled, Powerful, Reclusive)* whose goal is to find redemption.
- **Swordford** *(Exposed, Low, Grim)* where an innocent was accused.

**Progress: 13/40**

Then you would divide by 4 when comparing to challenge dice.

**Progress: 2.5/10**

Then you round down when comparing to challenge dice. *This is probably the least annoying way to represent the tick marks.*

## Story

Here is some narrative text. Game mechanics are represented by code. These can be either inline or in blocks.


The witch strikes you in the chest with her bony claws, `health -1`.


*I have grown bored of this miserable town. I think I shall set off in search of adventure.*
```
Undertake a Journey
Dangerous: 2 progress per waypoint
Challenge: [6, 9]
Action: [5] + 2 (wits) + 1 (community) = 8
> Weak Hit: mark progress, -1 supply
```
*The swamp to the south tried its best to kill me. I made it out though, and only lost my cloak because of it.*
