# Ironlands
*Adapted from the **Your World - Truths Workbook** *


## Truths

### The Old World

The Old World could no longer sustain us. We were too large in number. We had felled the forests. Our crops withered
in the barren ground. The cities and villages overflowed with desperate, hungry people. Petty kings battled for scraps. We
cast our fate to the sea and found the Ironlands. A new world. A fresh start.

*Quest Starter: Decades ago, the exodus ended. Since then, no ships have sailed here from the Old World. Until now. Word
comes of a single ship, newly arrived across the vast ocean, grounded on the rocks of the Barrier Islands. When you hear the
name of this ship, you swear to uncover the fate of its passengers. Why is it so important to you?*

### Iron

Inscrutable metal pillars are found throughout the land. They are iron gray, and smooth as river stone. No one knows
their purpose. Some say they are as old as the world. Some, such as the Iron Priests, worship them and swear vows upon
them. Most make the warding sign and hurry along their way when they happen across one. The pillars do not tarnish,
and even the sharpest blade cannot mark them.

*Quest Starter: Your dreams are haunted by visions of a pillar which stands in an unfamiliar landscape. What do you see?
Why are you sworn to seek it out?*

### Legacies

Other humans sailed here from the Old World untold years ago, but all that is left of them is a savage, feral people we call
the broken. Is their fate to become our own?

*Quest Starter: You find a child—one of the broken. It is wounded, and hunted by others of its kind. Do you protect it, even at
the risk of inviting the wrath of the broken tribes?*

### Communities

We live in communities called circles. These are settlements ranging in size from a steading with a few families to a village
of several hundred. Some circles belong to nomadic folk. Some powerful circles might include a cluster of settlements. We
trade (and sometimes feud) with other circles.

*Quest Starter: A decades-long feud between two circles has flared into open conflict. What is the cause of this dispute? Do you
join in the fight, or swear to put a stop to it?*

### Leaders

Each of our communities has its own leader, called an overseer. Every seventh spring, the people affirm their current
overseer or choose a new one. Some overseers wear the iron circlet reluctantly, while others thirst for power and gain it
through schemes or threats.

*Quest Starter: An overseer has fallen ill. She is sure to die without help, and the illness is unknown to the village healer.
Poison, or perhaps even foul magic, is suspected. The families in the community are now at each other’s throats as they
position their preferred candidates to take up the iron circlet. Will you discover the truth of the overseer’s illness and restore
her to health?*

### Defense

The wardens are our soldiers, guards, and militia. They serve their communities by standing sentry, patrolling
surrounding lands, and organizing defenses in times of crisis. Most have strong ties to their community. Others, called
free wardens, are wandering mercenaries who hire on to serve a community or protect caravans.

*Quest Starter: You come upon a dying warden. She tells you of an important mission, and charges you with its completion.
“Swear to me,” she says, reaching out with a bloodied hand to give you an object crucial to the quest. What is it?*

### Mysticism

Magic is rare and dangerous, but those few who wield the power are truly gifted.

*Quest Starter: You have heard stories of someone who wields true power. They live in an isolated settlement far away. Who
told you of this mystic? Are they feared or respected? Why do you swear to seek them out?*

### Religion

A few Ironlanders still make signs or mumble prayers out of habit or tradition, but most believe the gods long ago
abandoned us.

*Quest Starter: A charismatic Ironlander, encouraging her followers to renounce the vestiges of Old World religions, proposes a
new path for this new world. What doctrine does she teach? What does she seek to achieve? Are you sworn to aid or stop her?*

### Firstborn

The firstborn have passed into legend. Some say the remnants of the old tribes still dwell in deep forests or high
mountains. Most believe they were never anything more than myth.

*Quest Starter: Someone obsessed with the firstborn wants to find evidence of their existence. This will require an expedition
into the far reaches of the Ironlands. What is your role in this mission?*

### Beasts

Beasts of all sorts roam the Ironlands. They dwell primarily in the reaches, but range into the settled lands to hunt. There,
they often prey on cattle, but attacks on travelers, caravans, or even settlements are not uncommon.

*Quest Starter: Professional slayers earn their keep by killing beasts. This particular slayer, famed throughout the Ironlands for
her numerous kills, has gone missing on a hunt. Did she finally meet her match, or is something more nefarious at play. What
is your connection to her?*

### Horrors

Monstrous beasts stalk the wild areas of the Ironlands.

*Quest Starter: A prominent Ironlander is consumed with the need to bring vengeance upon a specific beast. What makes this
creature distinctive? How did it earn the wrath of this Ironlander? Do you aid this person in their quest, or act to prevent their
blind hate from destroying more than just the beast?*
